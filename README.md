Video Framing Demo
==================

This is a simple demo which works with Android's MediaMetadataRetriever class to extract frames from video file.
[FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever](https://github.com/wseemann/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever) library is used as a reimplementation of basic MediaMetadataRetriever class.

----------

1. On Settings view set desired frames frequency (for example, every 5 seconds)

2. Choose video file

3. Frames will be loaded and displayed in HorizontalScrollView

4. Tap on frame for preview

5. On Preview screen save frame in its origin quality
